## Heeeello, my name is Paulo Ricardo.  
A few months ago I started to study front-end development. I have always been interested in programming and decided to become a programmer. 
I'm not a programmer yet, that's my goal for 2023.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and I want to learn ReactJS soon
